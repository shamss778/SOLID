# SOLID Principles â€“ Lab Assignment
---
## Overview
This repository documents completed work exploring the five SOLID principles in Object-Oriented Design, each applied to Java code samples.
Each principle is covered by analyzing an initial solution, identifying its limitations, and presenting a refactored implementation that applies the respective SOLID guideline.

## Content Structure
The repository is organized with separate directories for each principle:

* SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

* OCP (Open-Closed Principle)

* LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

* ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

* DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

---

Each directory contains:

* The original code example.

* A refactored solution in the example_refactored subdirectory.

* An exercise folder showing a practical application of the principle.
